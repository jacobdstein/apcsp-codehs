I often play tennis. people played tennis with different raquets 50 years ago.
People play tennis the same way but with newer raquets. It has been affected by computer programs to give accurate calls in tournaments.
People will still play tennis in 20 years but with different raquets.
Computer programs will have the same role as they currently do in tennis.
