/*******************************************************************************

Programming languages follow the order of operations. Let's test this out.

Below is an expression. An expression can consist of a single value, a variable, 
an operator, or a procedure call that returns a value.

*******************************************************************************/

function start(){
	var first = 3;
	var second = 7;
	var third = 2;
	var expression = first + second + third;
	println(expression);
}

/*******************************************************************************

1. Change the second operator (the addition sign) to multiplication and run 
code. Which operation (add or multiply) is completed first?

2. Change the second operator to % (modulus or MOD). Which operation is 
completed first this time?

3. Can you change the expression so that the addition is completed first? How?
