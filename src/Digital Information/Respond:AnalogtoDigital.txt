1. Digital representation of analog data is a form of abstraction because it
cannot be properly be displayed due to having analog data being inbetween 0 and 
1. The computer abstracts this, however, by sepaarting the sound wave into 
managable chunks that the computer can read.

2. The quality is better with more samples because the more chunks that are
used, the more accurate the sound wave will be displayed.

3. Light is an example of analog data because it is also a wave.
